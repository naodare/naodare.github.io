                <p>Munch-kin is a pediatric dental office, located on East Hastings street, designed with the whole family in mind, making visits to the dentist calming for children and stress-free for parents. The project involved building up the strategic side of the brand first, followed by a complete visual identity to match.</p>

                    <p class="description">The full visual identity is layed out within a booklet, with details about the logo, colours, typography, and imagery. Their uses are showcased on a couple of print material examples.</p>

                <h3 class="no-arrow">Design Problem</h3>
                <p>How do you make children excited to go to the dentist? Most dental offices are very medical feeling, so the primary issue was to make the visual identity as inviting to children as possible. On the other hand, parents also need to feel the brand is trustworthy, professional, and capable of providing the best dental care.</p>

                    <h3>Brand Brief</h3>
                    <p class="description">In addition to the visual identity booklet, I created a matching brand brief booklet, that outlines all the positioning and details of how Munch-kin's brand operates. </p>

                <p>Compassionate — Reassuring — Trustworthy.<br>Nailing the tone of voice was paramount in bridging the gap between being child friendly and professional. We want to be like a friend you know you can always rely on. We listen to your problems with empathy and concern, and provide practical solutions to get you back in order.</p>

                    <h3>Wordmark</h3>
                    <p class="description">I created custom typography for the wordmark based on the geometric "U" shape and built the other letters from it. This shape is the basis for the majority of the visual identity, making the whole thing feel connected.</p>
