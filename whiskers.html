                <h3>About the Project&nbsp;&nbsp;→</h3>
                <p>The world of tech can be cold and unfeeling. Whiskers brings empathy and compassion through data driven preventative healthcare for pets. Co-founders Sarah and Jake are pet-loving engineers who built a collar device that tracks pet health and provides pet parents with real time data and insights about heart rate, activity, sleep patterns, behavioural changes, and more. Whiskers works directly with veterinarians to help the diagnosis and treatment process, easing the pain for pets, vets, and pet parents.</p>

                    <p class="description">The design of the shopping bags is a prime example of the "anti-brand" in action. The photography celebrates the materials, while echoing the black and white aesthetic of the brand identity. The relative size of the logo conveys the message that Browns is about the product, not the label.</p>

                <p>Self expression is key to feeling good every day. Look like yourself, feel like yourself. At Browns we believe in helping everyone build their own style that’s perfect for them.</p>

                    <h3>←&nbsp;&nbsp;Website</h3>
                    <p class="description">I refreshed the website with the new identity, focusing on using language to convey the brand's mission. This is seen in the button on the banner that reads "Shop Styles" instead of "Shop Shoes", as well as the tagline in the banner and the blurb at the bottom of the site.<br><br>One small detail that embodies the "anti-brand" is in the catalogue, where I emphasized the specific shoe name over the brand that it's from. The goal isn't to sell the label Browns, Lacoste, etc, it's to sell a shoe that fits <i>(both physically and stylistically)</i> each individual person.</p>

                <h3>Design Problem&nbsp;&nbsp;→</h3>
                <p>At the start of the project, I identified 3 main elements of the design problem that needed to be solved in order for the redesign to be successful: maintain the current brand values, make the visual identity feel contemporary, and bring youth, energy, and excitement to Browns.</p>
