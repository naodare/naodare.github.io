                <p>Whiskers brings warmth to an otherwise cold and unfeeling world of tech. Co-founders Sarah and Jake are pet-loving engineers who built a collar device that provides data-driven preventative healthcare for your furry family members. Whiskers works directly with veterinarians to help the diagnosis and treatment process, alleviating stress for pets, vets, and pet parents.</p>

                    <h3>Poster Ad</h3>
                    <p class="description">The brand mark was designed to be both a set of whiskers, as well as a speech lines, to represent the idea that Whiskers gives your pets a voice. Here on the poster it's used this way, in conjunction with the call to action, to essentially say that Whiskers lets your pets tell you what's wrong with them and how you can help.</p>

                <h3 class="no-arrow">Brand Mission</h3>
                <p>Collars are symbols of control. Whiskers aims to dispell this. I positioned Whiskers as the only collar that gives your pets freedom — the freedom to live their healthiest and happiest life.</p>

                    <p class="description">I mocked up a basic idea of what the app might look like in order to get a sense of how the typography and colours come together in a mixture of playful professionalism.</p>

                <p>The Whiskers brand exists at the intersection of 3 industries: health care, tech, animal care. Balancing these aspects of the brand in a way that was friendly to pet parents, while maintaining a professional and trustworthy appearance was the key to success.</p>

                    <h3>Logo</h3>
                    <p class="description">The wordmark represents data in the form of a bar graph, while the icon sits on either side creating a pair of whiskers around the name. I created a submark and icon variant for versatility across use cases, such as the app icon or a business card.</p>

                <h3 class="no-arrow">Target Audience</h3>
                <p>There are 3 groups that Whiskers has to consider with every decision. First, the pet parents. I primarily targeted millennials who consider their pets as family members, hence why Whiskers never says pet <i>owners</i>, always pet <i>parents</i>. Second, veterinarians. A huge element of what makes Whiskers stand out from the competition is their cooperation and connection with pet health professionals, so making sure the brand aligns with that world was important. Last, and certainly not least, the pets. This is more of a consideration for the product designers, but I always kept it in mind nonetheless.</p>
